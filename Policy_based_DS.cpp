Problem

perform the following Q queries on an initially Empty Set.

1 X -> insert X element in the set
2 X -> Remove X from the set
3 X -> print No. of elements smaller than X in the current set
4 X -> print element present at the Xth index in the Current set

constraints
-10^9 <= X <= 10^9
1 <= Q <= 10^5

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using a Vector

1 X -> insert X element in the set
O(N) if we want to keep it sorted

finding may take O(log(N)) but for insert O(N)

2 X -> Remove X from the set
O(N) to remove the element at any arbitrary index

3 X -> print No. of elements smaller than X in the current set
O(logN) Binary search

4 X -> print element present at the Xth index in the Current set
O(1) index Acess

let us find the time complexity
what is we are doing on Q quarries 
then O(Q) * O(N) it is not good

---------------------------------------------------------------------------

Using a Set


1 X -> Insert X element in the set
O(log(N))


2 X -> Remove X from the set
O(log(N))

3 X -> print No. of elements smaller than X in the current set
O(N) cannot Binary search on a set

4 X -> print element present at the Xth index in the Current set
O(N) no concept of index in a set

over all time complexity is O(Q) * O(N)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Ordered Set to the rescue

provides all the features of a traditional set and additional features 

->finding No. of elements smaller than X in the set 
A. order_of_key(X) -> O(logN)

->finding the element present at the Xth index in the set 
*A.find_by_order(X) -> O(logN)
